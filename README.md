# CS50AI

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (edX, Harvard)

### Overview
This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern
artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies
like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation.
Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph
search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and
other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they
incorporate them into their own Python programs. By courseâ€™s end, students
emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge
of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent
systems of their own.

### Objectives
Students who take CS50AI learn:
- graph search algorithms
- adversarial search
- knowledge representation
- logical inference
- probability theory
- Bayesian networks
- Markov models
- constraint satisfaction
- machine learning
- reinforcement learning
- neural networks
- natural language processing

### Projects
CS50AI includes seven lectures, each of which includes a problem set. The
problem sets require students to apply the topics covered during the lectures
in one or more projects. The project's instructions (I) and repository files
(R) can be accessed by clicking on the associated links.
